# Contiki for Vmote

The Vmote board is an atmega128rfa1 board with a few additions:

* 3 LED''s, mapped to LED_GREEN, LED_YELLOW, and LED_BLUE
* Only 1 UART exposed, so you have to choose between SLIP output and debugging output
* Button on pin 7, connected to ground when pressed
* Battery voltage divider on pin A1, divides battery voltage form 5V to 1.6V

Sensors are about to be added soon
